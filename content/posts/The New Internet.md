<!-- title: The New Internet -->


### Thesis

- The internet is evolving into infrastructure that is radically different from the current model. In particular, the evolution of IPFS and distributed consensus technology allows for the creation of web platforms that are non-local and user governed. 



### What do all these terms mean?

- Wat is IPFS

- distributed consensus? who cares?

### Old vs New

- AWS stack, single proprietary interface, your data is not your own vs IPFS/Blockchain stack, many possible interfaces, your data is in your custody

- Twitter: closed api. Cannot do arbitrary search. Cannot export your data: friends, tweets, etc. Can be arbitrarily censored or banned. No control over the interface.
	vs Nwitter: open by default api. Can run rich queries. You own your data and can take it anywhere. No one can ban you or censor you, only block you on an individual level. Because API is open, you can build any number of interfaces and protocols on top. Will even pay you to use it.


### Conclusion/So what

- The new model is more robust, less censorable, more scalable, less predatory, rewards the user/is more fair


### How you can get involved if you're excited

- IPFS, Polkadot/Cosmos chains
