<!-- title: Multimodal and IPFS -->

### Thesis
- IPFS/LD offers tremendous opportunity to build new and better ML models

Machine learning runs on embeddings. Embeddings run on tokenized lookup dictionaries. Hash indexing happens to be the perfect way to reference an embedding. Each unique object has a unique hash, and a unique embedding.

### Old\* model and what is working

- Giant LMs on codebook lookups
- Masked X Modeling works very well
- Multimodal training is fantastic

### Potential Features of the New Model

- IPLD addresses make amazing codebook targets
	- Common formats and such
- Backprop vs SOM vs Predictive Coding
- Distilation
- Retrieval

### Conclusion/So What

- Shared giant ML model
- Could help in [[TNI - Knowledge Curation]]
