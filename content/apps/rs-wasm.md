<!-- title: Rust/WASM Game of Life Demo -->
## About
A simple package that may or may not impress you about the oncoming world of wasm blobs serving you impressive browser embedded content.

A rendition of [the game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using rust and wasm-bindgen. The app is totally static and downloadable. The magic of static websites.
